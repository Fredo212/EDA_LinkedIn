# EDA_LinkedIn
A brief exploratory data analysis on a [LinkedIn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) that analyzes the relationship that the median salary of a job has with the industry it's in and the skills required to do said job. 

There were four files used in this analysis:

- [Job_postings.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatraj0502/linkedin-job-2023/data?select=job_postings.csv) - contains job LinkedIn job postings and their attributes. (Due to size limitations, the CSV file couldn't be uploaded to Github.)
- [Job_industries.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatraj0502/linkedin-job-2023/data?select=job_industries.csv) - contains the industry each job is in. Linked with an industry ID.
- [Job_skills.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatraj0502/linkedin-job-2023/data?select=job_skills.csv) - contains the professional skill (in abbreviated format) used in each job. Linked with a job ID.
- [skills.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings?select=maps) - contains professional skills in a non-abbreviated format.
